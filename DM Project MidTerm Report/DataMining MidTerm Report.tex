\section{Abstract}
\justifying
This report narrates few main aspects of the project like, our approach for dataset preparation starting from methods used for data extraction to steps involved in data pre-processing. It also describes the work done till now, with expected results followed by ways to evaluate them.
        
\section{Broad Aims of the project}
To create a model that predicts the number of child births and infant deaths in a year for all district of India.

\section{Datasets}
\subsection{Performance of Key Health Management Indicators for each district in India}
        
This data is released by Ministry of Health under National Health Mission flagship program which seeks to provide effective healthcare to the rural population throughout the country.

\bigskip

Data set includes the key indicators which affects health of mother and child during pregnancy and at the time of delivery. Data also reports the number of children born and number on infant deaths in each district in a particular year. Data set is available for years 2008 to 2019.

\subsection{Census Data 2001 and 2011}

The Census of India is conducted every 10 years Ministry of Home Affairs. The Census Data is available in public domain. The data is available at district level for total population, age, disability, education, migration, religion, and various other features.

\section{Data Preparation}

\subsection{Pre-processing of HMIS data:}

The data of the Health Management Information System (HMIS) database was given in the form of excel files and in state wise manner for each financial year from 2008-09 to 2018-19. Initially, the dataset contained a lot of unnecessary information that we did not use.

\bigskip

We have filtered the dataset and selected the relevant attributes for the prediction of the number of births in a particular district in a particular year.

\subsection{Pre-processing of Census data:}
The data of census was given in form of excel files. We have manually pre-processed the excel file to extract the required data. The data was present for the year 2001 and 2011. So we have generated the data for the years 2002-2019, using the Compound Interest formula.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Growth Rate(r) is calculated using the 2001 data as Principal(p) and 2011 data as the final amount(p+i). Here i is the Interest.
\item Data is generated for the remaining years using calculated growth rate(r).
\end{itemize}
Correction of district and state names over the years for both the datasets. As new districts are introduced, or name of a district is changed over the years 2008 to 2019.

\newpage

\section{Work Done Till Now.}
\subsection {Pre-processing: }
As a test case we have applied the above pre-processing and different Machine Learning techniques for the Gujrat state.

\bigskip

The data from the year 2008 to 2017 is used to train the models and the testing was done for the year 2018. We have predicted the no. of births for the year 2018 district wise in Gujrat state. There are 26 districts in Gujrat state. Each district is given a district id from the numbers 0-25. 

\bigskip

The Features used in training the models from HIMS datasets are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number having Hb level<11 (tested cases) 
\item Number having severe anaemia (Hb<7) treated at institution 
\item  Number of home deliveries attended by Non SBA trained (trained TB/Dai)
\item Number of C-section deliveries conducted at public facilities 
\item Number of C-section deliveries conducted at private facilities
\item Total Number of reported Still Births
\item Total Number of Abortions ( Spontaneous/ Induced) Reported
\item Total Number of MTPs ( Public) reported
\item Number of Vasectomies Conducted (Public + Pvt.)
\item Number of Tubectomies Conducted (Public + Pvt.)
\item Total Sterilisation Conducted
\item IUCD Insertions done (public facilities)
\item IUCD insertions done (pvt. facilities)
\item Oral Pills distributed
\item Condom pieces distributed
\item Adverse Events Following Immunisation (Others)
\item Number of Major Operations
\item Number of Minor Operations
\item Total Number of Infant Deaths reported
\end{itemize}

The Features used in training the models from census datasets are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Population Persons
\item Literate Persons
\item Main workers Persons
\item Marginal workers Persons
\item Non-workers Persons
\end{itemize}

The Random Forest Regressor Model performs the best with training accuracy of  99.15\% and testing accuracy of 94.41\%. 


\subsection{Results Evaluation}
\textit{Figure 1.} is the graph for prediction of births in Gujrat state district wise for the year 2018. The 'Districts' axis in the graph is 'district id' and 'Births' axis is the 'no of births in the corresponding district'.

\begin{itemize}
\item Total no. of Child Birth for the Year 2020.
\item Total no. of Infant Deaths for the Year 2020.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation of Results}
We will divide our datasets in two parts: Training set \& Test set. The data from the year 2008 to 2017 will be used as training set and the data for the year 2018 will be used as test set. Accuracy of the model developed will be evaluated based on this test set. \\
